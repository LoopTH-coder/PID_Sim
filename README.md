# Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a PID controller along with a test simulation designed to demonstrate its performance and robustness.

### The project was created to showcase:
* PID control behavior
* Integral windup prevention strategies
* A realistic first-order process simulation with lag
* Visualization of system response over time

The solution is designed to run on Windows and follows good software practices.
